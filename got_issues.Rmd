```

## Step 1: Explring `storms` data

The `storms` data are built-in to the `dplyr` package..

Get a summary for each variable: 
```{r}
summary(storm)
```

Look at the variable names: 
```{r}
Names(storms)
```

## Step 2: Exploratory visualization

```{r}
ggplot(data = storms, aes(x = category, y = pressure)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, 
              alpha = 0.5,
              aes(color = category),
              show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "StorM CategorRY", 
       y = "Air pressure at storm center (millibars)"
       ) +
  theme_void()
```
